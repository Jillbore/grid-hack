This is the Greenfoot version of the AP Computer Science case study "GridWorld", 
originally written by Cay Horstmann, and distributed by the College Board.

To use these projects, install Greenfoot (available from greenfoot.org). Then
start Greenfoot, select 'Open scenario', and open any of the three provided
scenarios.

The scenarios here, firstProject, boxBug, and critters, are the same as 
distributed with the original GridWorld version.

More information is available in each scenario's readme file. After opening
a scenario, you can read this file by clicking the 'Project Information' button.
